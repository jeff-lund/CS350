run:
    python3 main.py [select | insert | merge]

Dependencies: matplotlib

Use of virtual environments is recommended with Python to install dependencies
To create a virtual environment: 
    virtualenv <Dir>
    ex. virtualenv env

To activate a virtual environment:
    source <Dir>/bin/activate
    ex. source env/bin/activate

When active you will see a (env) prepended to your prompt on the command line

You can now install modules local to the environment. You will only be able to use
these modules while the virtual environment is active. You will need to use a virtual
environment to install modules in the linux labs.

To install a module:
    pip3 install matplotlib

To deactivate virtual environment:
    deactivate

Without arguments will sort playing cards using Python's builtin Timsort
If an optional argument is provided the program will instead use the 
following sorting algorithm:
    select: Selectionsort
    insert: Insertionsort
    merge:  Mergesort
